What does this tool do?

- Creates a backup automatically from the original file
- It saves a copy of the original .nk using \*\_backup.nk file prior to make any changes. (always back up your files!)
- Eliminate disconnected nodes, dot nodes as well.
- Organizes nodes horizontally.
- shows up a pop message once the process is complete.
